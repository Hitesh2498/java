constructor overloading           :- a constructor is a block of codes similar to the method. It is called when an  
                                     instance of the class is created. At the time of calling constructor, memory for 
                                     the object is allocated in the memory.calls a default constructor if there is no  
                                     constructor available in the class
                                     Constructor name must be the same as its class name
                                     A Constructor must have no explicit return type
                                     A Java constructor cannot be abstract, static, final, and synchronized

                                    (default constructor) :doesn't have any parameter.used to provide the default      
                                                           values to the object like 0, null,

                                     (parameterized constructor):-A constructor which has a specific number of  
                                                                parameters, A constructor which has a specific number

                                     CONSTRUCTOR OVERLOADING :-Constructor overloading in Java is a technique of 
                                     having more than one constructor with different parameter lists. They are 
                                     arranged in a way that each constructor performs a different task, differentiated 
                                     by the compiler by the number of parameters in the list and their types.

function/ method overloading      :-same name same class and different parameters

function/method overriding        :-same name different class 

oops feature                      :-1.object :- Any entity that has state and behavior is known as an object
                                    2.class :- Collection of objects is called class. It is a logical entity
                                    3.Inheritance :- When one object acquires all the properties and behaviors of a parent

                                                       polymorphism.we use method overloading and method overriding to 
                                                       achieve polymorphism
                                    5.Abstraction :- Hiding internal details and showing functionality is known as  
                                                     abstraction
                                    6.Encapsulation :-Binding (or wrapping) code and data together into a single unit are 
                                                      known as encapsulation.
what is java                      :-Java is a high-level and purely object oriented 
                                    programming language. It is platform independent, robust, secure, and multithreaded 
                                    programming language which makes it popular among other OOP languages. It is widely     
                                    used for software, web, mobile application development, 

AWT                               :-AWT stands for Abstract Window Toolkit. It is a platform-dependent API to  
                                    develop GUIIt is heavy-weight in use because it is generated by the systemâ€™s 
                                    host operating system. It contains a large number of classes and methods, 
                                    which are used for creating and managing GUI. AWT provides comparatively less powerful  
                                    components.

SWING                             :- Swing is a lightweight Java graphical user interface (GUI) that is used to   
                                     create various applications. Swing has platform-independent components. It 
                                     enables the user to create buttons and scroll bars. Swing includes packages 
                                     for creating desktop applications in Java. Swing components are written in      
                                     Java language. It is a part of Java Foundation Classes(JFC). Swing provides more powerful components.
